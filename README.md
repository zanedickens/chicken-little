# Chicken Little - A simple weather app
Is the sky falling? No it's raining. Temperature's 22 degrees. Wind is a raging gale. You get the idea...

It checks your location, then polls the Open Weather API; to see if the sky is falling.

## Makes use of: 
- AngularJS 1.5
- Bootstrap 3
- This great font for the weather symbols based on Open Weather API icon codes: http://websygen.github.io/owfont/
- AngularJS GeoLocation: https://github.com/arunisrael/angularjs-geolocation
